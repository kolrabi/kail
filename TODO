
1.9.0:

  - Thread local states for ILU and ILUT
  - More format tests

2.0.0:

  - iluSimilarity() to get a value of how similar two images are
  - Use iluSimilarity() in tests to check loading and saving by
    comparing it against a known good sample.
  
  - SDL2 ILUT

  - Add IL_IMAGE_OFFSET_MODE ( values IL_RELATIVE or IL_ABSOULTE ), 
    changes behaviour of ilActive*(); 
  
  - Add ilClampMode():
    - IL_WRAP
    - IL_CLAMP

  - iluToneMap()

  - ilIsEnabled(IL_PNG) etc. to check for supported formats.

  - JBIG

  - FLI/FLC?

  - Gif save support

  - Save support for all untested formats, so we can create files to check
    with other programs, then use them as references for format tests.

future:

  - Set strings from loaded images?
  - Unify strings like IL_PNG_AUTHNAME_STRING, IL_TGA_AUTHNAME_STRING, IL_TIF_AUTHNAME_STRING ?
  - Load exif data
