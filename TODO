future:

  - Extend Metadata support
    - GeoTIFF
    - XMP? 
    - IPTC?

  - IL:
    - More tests:
      - BLP1
      - BMP: OS/2, Uncompressed RLE 4bit
      - blitting
      - mipmaps for formats that support them (DDS)
      - layers for formats that support them (PSD, FITS)
    - New pixel formats for IL_SHORT: 
      - IL_RGB_555
      - IL_RGB_565
      - IL_ARGB_1555
    - New formats
      - FLI/FLC?
      - JXR/HD Photo
      - WebP
      - JBIG, JBIG2
      - Camera raw formats (dng, .nef, .crw, .orf ...)
      - vector formats:
        - SVG
        - EPS
    - Gif save support
    - Save support for all untested formats, so we can create files to check
      with other programs, then use them as references for format tests.
    - Make PSD loader handle layers correctly
    - support n-dimensional images (eg. for fits)

  - ILU:
    - ILU_SIMILARITY_MODE:
      - ILU_SIMILARITY_PIXELS
      - ILU_SIMILARITY_HISTOGRAM
    - iluToneMap()
    - ILU selection (extension of region)
      - iluCopySelection() (copy only selected pixels)
    - some kind of iluMixSlices (eg. convert FITS to colour)?

  - ILUT:
    - Tests
    - Finish DirectX10/11 support
